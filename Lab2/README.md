# ce888labs â€“ LAB 2

In Lab 2 we used Spyder to plot histograms and scatter plots for the current fleet and the proposed fleet, ploting it's important because it's a way to visualise data and see its behaviour. In the following graphs we can see the differences between the current fleet and the new fleet.

After that we created the bootstrap function which help us creating confidence intervals:

We see that the upper, men and lower we have for the current fleet:
(20.141535341365465, 19.353413654618475, 20.935843373493974)

We see that the upper, men and lower we have for the new fleet:
(30.48787215189873, 29.151898734177216, 31.848101265822784)

As discussed in class, the mean of the new fleet is greter that the one we see in the current fleet, meaning that we prefer the new format or the new fleet better.
